# Blender Hobo
Decrease the amount of VRAM used by textures in your scene by a factor of 9!
As a bonus, this will also make some textures contribute less to the render times!


# Installation:
 - Download the repo as zip.
 - Install zip as addon.
 - Go to the preferences of the installed addon and specify a path to an existing empty folder where all the optimized stuff would go.
 - And VERY important: RESTART BLENDER

# How to use:
Look for a Hobo panel in the N-menu panel in the 3D Viewport, Node Editor and Imge Editor, play around, it's pretty self-explanatory...

Make sure to leave feedback.
